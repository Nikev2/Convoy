## Script here for people who don't want to listen to this recipie!
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikev2/Convoy/refs/heads/main/ConvoyInstaller.lua"))()
```
Convoy is a autofarming tool for the old game of Ultimate Driving. After the exploit SynX betrayed the cheating community and I lost my own script I decided to quit this thing for a while. I rediscoverd this exploit. This has be to be the most advanced autofarm I ever worked on thank you TTP for giving me more lua coding experince! Anyway what it does is use a shit ton of things called route files and positions aka ".UDCF" files to mimic truck driving and make you tons of money.


Note that it downloads the files its only a few megabytes of Files with tons of random CFrames in them. There just rebranded ```.JSON``` files
